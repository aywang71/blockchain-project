Summary: Smart contract system and application set up to distribute the funding of a charitable trust: 

Background: https://www.npr.org/2023/02/22/1158865140/stray-cats-dixfield-maine-trust-inheritance-will


Backend smart contract controls and distributes assets of a charitable trust

Prior to the formation of the charitable trust, the person putting funds into the trust would specify criteria for withdrawls from the trust

They could (may or may not be) a third-party group set up to manage the funds of the charitable trust after the individual dies, who can vote on it

Alternatively, it could be done automatically? Not entirely sure how this would work

Tech stack:
- Frontend: Interaction, proposals to the trust, request funding withdrawals from the trust, see history of trust proposals and withdrawals, etc. 
- Backend: Smart contract that maintains funds and recieves and reacts to proposals
	Depending on implementation, there could be a seperate smart contract that contacts the third-party that verifies proposals, as well as some sort of server or array that logs proposals
