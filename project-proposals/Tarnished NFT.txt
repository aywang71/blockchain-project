Summary: An NFT that changes color or hue over time the more times it changes owners. Like a coin, it may "tarnish" over time as it is exchange more

(I think) Backend would alter the pixel composition of the NFT slightly, or you would maintain a list of NFT that tarnish over time, and return an index increased by 1 (increases the tarnish-level by 1) and burn previous. Not sure what the best implementation of this would be

Tech stack:
- Frontend auctioning site. (Not sure if this would need to be different from a typical auction frontend setup)
- Backend: standard 3 smart contract setup for auctioning setup, the actual NFT smart contract would need to be altered to slightly change the IPFS or something every time the NFT exchanges owners. 
	One complexity would be making sure the owner cannot exchange it to themselves (start an auction and then end it rapidly to gain tarnish level) 

The implication would be that as the NFT tarnishes over time it supposedly increases implicitly in value 2
